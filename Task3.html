        <p>
            A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form
        </p>
        <p class="formula_paragraph">
          <span class="formula">ax + b = 0</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            where <span class="accent">a</span> and <span class="accent">b</span> are real numbers and x
            <span class="accent">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation.
            Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, 
            the variable may or may not be an <span class="accent">x</span> so don–¢t get too locked into 
            always seeing an <span class="accent">x</span> there.

            The standard form of a quadrtic equation looks like this:

        <p class="formula_paragraph">

        <p>
            where <span class="accent">a, b, c</span> are known values and <span class="accent">x</span> 
            is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="accent">a</span> 
            can't be 0.

        <p>
            That is, <span class="accent">x</span> is an element of the intersection A &#8745; B if and only if x is both an element of <span class="accent">A</span> and an element of <span class="accent">B</span>.
